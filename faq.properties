rdp.faq.answers.what=ModelMatcher is a global registry and search tool that connects clinicians and basic scientists. Our goal is to bring these communities together to facilitate mutually beneficial collaborative projects that advance scientific knowledge and patient care.
rdp.faq.answers.purpose=The primary goal of ModelMatcher is to serve as a universal tool that brings together clinicians and basic scientists to facilitate mutually beneficial collaborations while respecting the privacy of both parties. ModelMatcher aims to facilitate the studies of rare and undiagnosed diseases, but can also be used to propel research on common diseases.

rdp.faq.answers.privacy=<p>The registry is password-protected and the information you enter will be kept secure. \
The visibility of your information depends on your <a href="#privacy-settings">Data Privacy</a> setting for each gene you select. The management team of the ModelMatcher project will have access to all data for administrative purposes but any information that are classified as Restricted will remain strictly confidential and will not be shared with external groups.</p>
rdp.faq.answers.privacy-settings=<p>Data Privacy Settings section on your Profile page lets you choose your data sharing preferences. The default setting for each gene is pre-selected to Public, but can be changed. The options are:\
<ul><li><b>restricted</b> - your information will be accessible by Clinical Users who will be registering their info in ModelMatcher. Clinical Users who register in ModelMatcher can attempt to match with a Scientist User who express interest in a specific gene as Public or Restricted information to discuss potential opportunities for collaboration. In the future, Restricted information will also be shared with Clinical Users of federated clinical matchmaking databases that are part of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.matchmakerexchange.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-ogsc="">MatchMaker Exchange</a>&nbsp;to facilitate collaboration between clinicians and scientists. Scientist Users who are part of ModelMatcher will not be able to see other user&rsquo;s Restricted information, providing confidentiality on information that may be related to unpublished data.</li> \
<li><b>Public</b> - Your information will be visible publicly. Anyone can obtain information on these genes through the ModelMatcher&rsquo;s public search webpage (<em><a href="https://www.modelmatcher.net:8443/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-ogsc="">https://www.modelmatcher.net:8443</a></em>). This information will also be shared with our partner model organism registries including&nbsp;<a href="https://register.rare-diseases-catalyst-network.ca/search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-ogsc="">RDMM (Canada)</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://rdmm.imgag.de/search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-ogsc="">Solve-RD (Europe)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.functionalgenomics.org.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-ogsc="">AFGN (Australia)</a>.</li></p>
rdp.faq.answers.isearch=ModelMatcher is connected with model organism researcher registries around the world in order to maximize collaboration efforts. We share data between these registries so people on those systems can find collaborators on our system and vice versa. Currently, we partner with&nbsp;<a href="https://register.rare-diseases-catalyst-network.ca/search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-ogsc="">RDMM (Canada)</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://rdmm.imgag.de/search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-ogsc="">Solve-RD (Europe)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.functionalgenomics.org.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-ogsc="">AFGN (Australia)</a>, and this list may grow as more and more registries are established with similar goals and virtues.

rdp.faq.answers.process=Briefly, the Scientific Advisory \
Committee (SAC) will attempt to match a new disease gene to as \
many model organism researchers as possible, based on the \
genes that model organism researchers have self-declared. The \
SAC will then invite the model organism researcher to submit a \
2-page application (receipt deadline within a week or two). \
The SAC will review the applications (within a week), and for \
those accepted, will invite the clinician scientist to \
establish a connection with the corresponding model organism \
researcher. Following a successful connection, the model \
organism lab will be connected to the clinician scientist and \
receive $25,000 to seed immediate collaborative experiments.

rdp.faq.answers.organisms=ModelMatcher supports Mouse, Rat, Zebrafish, Fruit Fly, Nematode Worm, Budding Yeast and E. coli. For these species, you can input your genes of interest using the gene symbols for each species, and ModelMatcher will convert them to Human ortholog candidates based on information from <a href="https://www.flyrnai.org/cgi-bin/DRSC_orthologs.pl" target="_blank">DIOPT</a>. 
If you work on model organisms other than these species including human (cell culture etc), you can add your information under “Human or Other”, and input your genes of interest using Human gene symbols approved by HGNC.

rdp.faq.answers.genes=<p>Key to the success of the Network is our ability to \
match human disease genes to model organism researchers who \
can study those genes. We recognize that for any given human \
gene, there is a limited chance that a model organism \
researcher in Canada is actively studying that specific gene. \
Therefore we need to be able to cast a wider net. On the \
other hand, we must strike a balance between restricting the \
genes registered and assuming that every lab can study any \
gene.</p> \
<p>To reach this balance, genes are divided into Tiers:</p> \
<ul> \
<li><b>Tier 1 or Primary genes</b> are those you \
currently work on in a model organism. You must be able to \
immediately, specifically and rapidly study them in your \
laboratory. Genes you have recently published on are \
especially good Primary genes. We expect this to typically \
be between one and ten genes. \
</li> \
<li><b>Tier 2 genes or Secondary</b> are those you do not mark as \
Primary. Carefully choose genes which you are not \
necessarily actively investigating but would be able to work \
on rapidly and specifically with minimal set-up time. These \
might be paralogs of Tier 1 genes, or members of the same \
complexes or pathway. For most registrants we expect there \
might be between one and 100 non-Primary genes entered. \
</li> \
</ul> \
<p> \
See also the question about <a href="#genome">I study the entire genome</a>. \
</p> \
\
<p>Remember that entering genes into the registry is only \
the first step in the process. For a given \
human gene needing a match, we will first look for \
registrants who list an ortholog as a Primary (Tier 1) gene. \
If no match is found, the other Tiers will be searched. 
rdp.faq.answers.more=You have the ability to select multiple model organisms and organ systems for each gene on your profile. For example, you could say that you work on one gene in the Mouse while you study the same or another set of genes in the Fruit Fly.


rdp.faq.answers.human=Yes, if you have an appropriate \
system to study candidate genes as would be required to \
contribute to the understanding of the identified human \
disease genes. This might include biochemical assays or assays \
based on cell lines. \
Do not register human genes merely because they are orthologs \
of the genes you study in a model organism.

rdp.faq.answers.missing=<p>The registry was constructed assuming that the vast majority of registrants work on one or more of the most popular model organisms, but we recognize this does not cover all researchers. If your organism is not listed, please select the &ldquo;Human or Other&rdquo; option and specify the name (common name as well as specific species name) organism you are working in the &ldquo;Organism Research Focus&rdquo; text box. Please add the gene of expertise/interest using the official human gene symbol (using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.genenames.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-ogsc="">HGNC nomenclature</a>) of the homologous/orthologous gene you study in your organism. To identify the closest homolog of your gene of interest, you can use tools such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flyrnai.org/cgi-bin/DRSC_orthologs.pl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-ogsc="">DIOPT</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.genenames.org/tools/hcop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-ogsc="">HCOP</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE=Proteins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable" data-ogsc="">Protein BLAST</a>&nbsp;or manually perform phylogenetic analysis.</p> See also <a href="#genes">Which genes should I enter into the \
registry?</a> and <a href="#human">Are humans a "model"</a>.

rdp.faq.answers.genome=We recognize that many labs can \
study any gene. The intention of this program is to identify \
researchers who have an existing history of research in \
orthologs of genes identified in human rare disease studies \
(ideally, who are poised to immediately conduct functional \
analyses that inform a human disease gene that has been \
discovered). You should register the genes that you can \
specifically and rapidly study in your laboratory. See \
<a href="#purpose">What is the purpose of the registry?</a> and \
<a href="#genes">Which genes should I enter into the registry?</a>.

rdp.faq.answers.ortholog=Only register human genes if you are working on them or work on a species that are not supported by ModelMatcher.
