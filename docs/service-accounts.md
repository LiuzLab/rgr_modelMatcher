# Service accounts

Using a service account is the preferred way of bridging your registry with
your partners and external applications.

They constitute special kind of users with almost admin-like access, but
without the ability to modify data or access administrative endpoints.

To create a service account, go under `/admin/create-service-account` and
choose a displayed name and email. Newly created service account have an access
token setup that can be used for accessing your registry through its [public API](/api).
